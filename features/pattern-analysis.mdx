## Pattern Detection Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Transaction Analysis">
    The system analyzes:
    - **Frequency**: Monthly, quarterly, annual patterns
    - **Amount Consistency**: Similar amounts over time
    - **Merchant Patterns**: Recurring merchants and vendors
    - **Date Patterns**: Regular due dates and payment cycles
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pattern Recognition">
    Identifies patterns using:
    - **Machine Learning**: Advanced pattern recognition algorithms
    - **Statistical Analysis**: Frequency and variance analysis
    - **Temporal Analysis**: Time-based pattern detection
    - **Amount Clustering**: Similar amount groupings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confidence Scoring">
    Provides confidence levels:
    - **High (90-100%)**: Very reliable pattern
    - **Medium (70-89%)**: Likely pattern, review recommended
    - **Low (50-69%)**: Uncertain pattern, manual verification needed
  </Step>
</Steps>
